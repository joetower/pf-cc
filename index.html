          South Dakota's 2024 season promises unparalleled opportunities
        </h2>

        <p class="blog__intro">
          From thriving pheasant populations to new public lands and mixed-bag hunts, South Dakota's 2024 season
          promises unparalleled opportunities for upland bird hunters.
        </p>

        <p>South Dakota looks and feels quite a bit different heading into this pheasant season. Drought and severe
          winter weather have dominated the headlines the past few years, but this year ... this year it’s a different
          story.</p>

        <p>After a mild winter left plenty of birds on the landscape, Mother Nature cooperated even further by sending
          round after round of timely rains. As a result, grassland habitat across the state’s primary pheasant range
          rebounded in a big way. In fact, reports from wildlife biologists across pheasant country affirm that nesting
          and brood-rearing habitat conditions were ideal. The one exception was the southeastern corner of the state,
          which saw excessive rainfall and flooding in June that disrupted nesting efforts.</p>

        </div>

        <p>
          So, what does all of this mean for pheasants and pheasant hunters? In short, rain makes grass and bugs, and
          grass and bugs make birds. And more grass and more birds combine to create more opportunities for pheasant
          hunters like you and me. In other words, if you’re a bird hunter and it’s been a few years since you’ve been
          to South Dakota or if it’s still on your bucket list, you’d be wise not to miss out on this season.
        </p>

        <h2>
          The Birds are Back
        </h2>

        <p>
          Pheasants are extremely resilient. If you’ll remember, the winter of 2022-2023 was one of the most severe on
          record, creating fears the state’s bird population took a hit. However, hunters harvested more than 1.2
          million birds last season, according to data from the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Department (GFP).
          Those encouraging numbers suggest the state carried a strong breeding population into this past winter, and,
          as mentioned, the change in weather patterns has given the pheasant population a giant shot in the arm.
        </p>

        <p>
          As evidence, in <a href="https://pheasantsforever.org/forecast">Pheasants Forever’s 2024 pheasant
            forecast</a>, wildlife biologists from around the state have reported numerous and consistent brood
          sightings this summer. What’s even better is that many of these reports mention that chick size varies by
          brood — a sign that renesting efforts were successful in areas impacted by heavy rains.
        </p>

        <p>“It’s looking like it will be the best fall in a long time,” says Matt Gottlob, Pheasants Forever’s state
          coordinator in South Dakota. “Most of the people I talk to in the state are saying bird numbers are as good as
          they can remember. And that’s not just pheasants. They’re seeing sharptails, prairie chickens and even lots of
          partridge in places. It’s going to be a heckuva fall for birds.”</p>

        <p>And if that isn’t enough to get you excited, here are five additional reasons you visit South Dakota this
          fall.</p>

        <h3>1. More Public Land</h3>

        <p>Don’t be fooled by the perception that private land is always better than public land. South Dakota has over
          5 million acres of public land, and while not every public acre will have birds on it, there are plenty that
          do. In fact, sometimes public land offers the best habitat for miles around — and where there’s quality
          habitat, there will be birds, too.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img
            alt="A woman wearing a bright orange vest and bright orange hat holds a rifle upright as she walks through a field with a brown/black dog behind her"
            src="assets/horizSlim-800x200-SDnative-hunterGunDog-(1).jpg" />
        </div>

        <p>Plus, a couple brand-new public hunting opportunities are just waiting for you this year. For starters,
          Pheasants Forever’s Public Access to Habitat (PATH) program has added 16,000 acres in its first year alone.
          The PATH program kicked off in September 2023 with the goal of accelerating the enrollment of birdy-looking
          private land into the GFP’s Walk-In Area program. More reason for excitement is that this is all new ground
          that wasn’t previously enrolled in a different conservation program.</p>

        <p>Second, the Big Sioux Watershed Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) keeps marching toward its
          goal of enrolling 25,000 acres of publicly accessible ground across 18 counties in eastern South Dakota. Now
          in its second year, the Big Sioux program looks to build off the success of the James River CREP, which is
          also nearing its goal of enrolling 100,000 acres of habitat up and down the James River Valley, home to
          well-known pheasant towns such as Aberdeen, Redfield, Huron, Mitchell and all the places in between.</p>

        <h3>2. Mixed-Bag Opportunities</h3>

        <p>While pheasant is king of the Dakotas, other upland opportunities are often forgotten. What’s worse, they’re
          sometimes taken for granted. If you’ve only been lucky enough to pick up a sharptail, prairie chicken or
          partridge as a bonus bird while hunting pheasants, take some time this fall to hunt the short grass and add
          some spice to your hunt.</p>

        <p>Like pheasants, prairie grouse had phenomenal nesting and brood-rearing seasons, so good numbers of grouse
          await hunters this fall in the central and western parts of the state. To help you get started on a mixed-bag
          hunt, check out <a href="https://www.pheasantsforever.org/primer">Pheasants Forever’s Prairie Grouse
            Primer</a>, which includes a lengthy report on South Dakota’s sharptail grouse and prairie chicken prospects
          this fall.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Cast and Blast</h3>

        <p>In addition to world-renowned pheasant hunting, , South Dakota is also home to some of the best fishing
          opportunities in the Midwest.
        </p>

        <p>The Missouri River Valley is traditionally a pheasant hotspot, but the Might Mo’s reservoirs are also
          world-class walleye, pike and smallmouth bass fisheries. The same can be said for the Glacial Lakes region of
          northeastern South Dakota, where the sloughs hold cover for birds and the lakes hold healthy populations of
          walleyes and other popular gamefish, including smallies, panfish and pike.</p>

        <p>Don’t have time, you say? Remember, shooting hours for pheasants don’t start until 10 a.m., so make the most
          of your trip by waking up early and catching enough fish for a shore lunch before heading afield for the day.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Pass on the Tradition</h3>

        <p>With a healthy bird population and plenty of public opportunities, there’s never been a better time to pass
          along the outdoor tradition to your kids, grandkids or even other adults in your circle who’ve shown an
          interest in hunting.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="assets/sqrImg-400x400-SDnativeHuntersGunsDogs.jpg"
            alt="A woman and a man are standing in tall grass, wearing bright orange coats/vests and bright orange hats, holding rifles in an upright position. There are two brown/black dogs to the left of theme." />
        </div>

        <p>Turn it into even more of an adventure for your entire family by making plans to camp or stay at any of the
          numerous state parks or recreation areas dotting the map. Often overlooked, these well-maintained areas are
          found in some of the state’s most scenic areas. Sure, the state has plenty of quality lodging options, from
          dog-friendly hotels to grand lodges that all roll out the red carpet for hunters, but if you want to get away
          from it all or if you’re on a budget, camping is worth a second look.</p>

        <h3>5. Lifetime Memories</h3>

        <p>South Dakota's 2024 pheasant season is shaping up to be one of the best in recent memory. With prime
          grassland conditions and healthy bird numbers, hunters are in for a treat. Add to that the expanded public
          access, mixed-bag hunting opportunities, and the chance to enjoy some of the best fishing in the Midwest, and
          it becomes clear why this year is not to be missed.</p>

        <p>
          Whether you're a seasoned hunter or passing the tradition on to a new generation, <a
            href="https://www.travelsouthdakota.com/recreation/hunting" target="_blank">start planning your trip to
            South Dakota today</a>. You won’t just leave with birds in your bag — you’ll leave with memories that last a
